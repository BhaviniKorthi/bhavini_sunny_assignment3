NOTE:

1. Dataset used: CIFAR 10

2. We can changes values of epochs in the slider to view the plot for a particular epoch.

3. On the sidebar, we can select the pages as either Slider or Reconstructed Images. By selecting slider we can view the plots for different epochs and by selecting Reconstructed Images, we can see the original and reconstructed images made by the model.

4. All the plots and outputs are saved in the file plots which is used to display in the streamlit app.
